# Google Classroom Submission Guide

**For students**
- Create your work in Google Docs unless the assignment says otherwise.
- Name files clearly: `LastName_AssignmentName` (e.g., `Lopez_A3_Teamwork`).
- Attach all required files to the Classroom post (Doc + resume/cover letter when needed).
- Share settings: “Anyone with the link can view/comment” so the teacher can access easily.
- Turn in the assignment in Classroom after attaching files.
- Daily: add a 1–2 sentence log in Pika about what you worked on.

**For teachers**
- Attach the universal /15 rubric to each post.
- Paste the daily Pika reminder in every assignment description.
- Encourage students to attach drafts/process notes to support authenticity checks.
