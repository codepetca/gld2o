# Final Summative — Google Sites Portfolio

**Purpose**: showcase your learning across the course in a single, easy-to-navigate Google Site.

## What to include (pages/sections)
1) **Home**: short intro and a “site tour” telling visitors where to find everything.  
2) **About Me**: profile highlights (strengths, interests, values) and one story that represents you.  
3) **Personal Management**: key takeaways and link(s) to the Assignment 3 Doc.  
4) **Essential Skills**: highlights from your scheduling/budgeting tasks with artifacts.  
5) **Career Exploration**: summaries for each occupation you researched, plus sources.  
6) **Decision-Making & Barriers**: your decision matrix and how you handled barriers.  
7) **Career Plan & Job Search**: plan overview, resume, cover letter; include the job posting summary.  
8) **Personal Interest Project (if applicable)**: brief description and evidence.  
9) **Final Reflection**: one paragraph on growth, most useful skill, and next steps.

## Quality bar
- **Navigation**: clear menu, consistent headings, and working links.  
- **Evidence**: include at least two in-progress artifacts (drafts/notes) somewhere on the site.  
- **Authenticity**: show your own words and examples; revisions are noted where they happened.

## How to submit
- Post your Site URL and a 4–5 sentence tour paragraph in Google Classroom; ensure link sharing allows teacher access.  
- Daily: log what you worked on in Pika (1–2 sentences) until submission.
