# Digital Scavenger Hunt (Onboarding)

**Purpose**: practice the course workflow, use the assigned Google Doc, and show daily Pika check-ins. Collect screenshots as proof for each step.

**Learning goals (student-friendly)**  
- Use the assigned Google Doc for submissions.  
- Follow step-by-step instructions and capture evidence.  
- Build the habit of daily Pika check-ins.

## What to do (complete in the assigned Google Doc)
Take a screenshot for each task and paste them all into the Doc (add a short caption under each).

1) **Dino Run** — Play until at least 100 points. Screenshot your game. To play, turn off Wi‑Fi, visit www.google.com, then hit the space bar. Challenge: can you get the class high score?  
2) **Google Trick** — Search “do a barrel roll.” Screenshot the spin in action.  
3) **YouTube Explorer** — Search “world’s shortest video.” Find the original famous one and screenshot the YouTube page that contains it.  
4) **Submission readiness check** — Confirm in the Doc that you know how to take screenshots (if not, ask ChatGPT/Google).

## Deliverable
- The assigned Google Doc containing all screenshots and captions.

## How to submit
- Attach/turn in your Doc in Google Classroom.  
- Daily: log what you worked on in Pika (1–2 sentences).

## Success criteria (universal /15 rubric)
- **Completion**: all four tasks have screenshots and captions.  
- **Thinking/communication**: captions are clear; steps followed exactly.  
- **Workflow/authenticity**: daily Pika check-ins, assigned Google Doc used, your own screenshots.
