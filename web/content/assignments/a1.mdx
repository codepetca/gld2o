# Orientation + Personal Profile (Formative)

**Purpose**: onboard to the course, get comfortable with the workflow, and share a quick “about me.” This is formative (practice) and keeps you on track for daily Pika check-ins.

**Learning goals (student-friendly)**  
- Identify interests, strengths, needs, and values that shape your choices.  
- Connect past experiences to future goals.  
- Follow directions and organize work in a clear, authentic way.

## What to do (complete in the assigned Google Doc)
1) **Personal profile**: list your top strengths, interests, values, and needs (bullet points are fine). Include one short story (5–7 sentences) about when you used one of these strengths.  
2) **Learning/work experiences**: note 2–3 experiences (school, volunteer, job, family responsibilities) and what you learned from each.  
3) **Goals**: write 2 short-term goals (this semester) and 1 longer-term goal (after high school), plus one action for each goal.  

## Deliverable
- The assigned Google Doc with the three sections completed.

## How to submit
- Attach/turn in your Doc in Google Classroom.  
- Daily: log what you worked on in Pika (1–2 sentences).

## Success criteria (universal /15 rubric)
- **Completion**: all sections are present and follow the steps.  
- **Thinking/communication**: clear, specific examples; short stories are readable.  
- **Workflow/authenticity**: daily Pika check-ins, organized Doc, your own words and experiences.
