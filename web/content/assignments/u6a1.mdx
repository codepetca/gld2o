# Create Google Site & Upload All Work

**Purpose**: build a Google Site that organizes your course work for sharing and evaluation.

**Learning goals**  
- Present your work clearly for different audiences.  
- Organize artifacts with simple navigation and headings.  
- Demonstrate workflow and authenticity by showing evidence of process.

## What to do
1) Create a new Google Site. Use clear page names and simple navigation.  
2) Required pages/sections: Home (intro + site tour), Orientation, Essential Skills, Personal Management, Career Exploration, Decision-Making & Barriers, Career Plan & Job Search, Final Reflection.  
3) For each unit page: add a short overview (2–3 sentences) and embed/link your Docs. If you revised work, note what changed.  
4) Evidence of process: add at least 1–2 in-progress artifacts (drafts, notes, schedules) across the site to show how you worked.  
5) Final reflection page: one paragraph on your growth, most useful skill gained, and what you will do next.

## Deliverable
- Google Site URL + a short “tour” paragraph describing where to find everything.

## How to submit
- Paste the Site URL and tour paragraph in Google Classroom; ensure link sharing allows teacher access.  
- Daily: log what you worked on in Pika (1–2 sentences).

## Success criteria (universal /15 rubric)
- **Completion**: all required pages, embedded/linked artifacts, and reflection.  
- **Thinking/communication**: navigation is clear; explanations are concise; artifacts match pages.  
- **Workflow/authenticity**: evidence of drafts/process, daily Pika check-ins, working links.
