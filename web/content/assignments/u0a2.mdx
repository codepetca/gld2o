# Personal Interest Proposal

**Purpose**: propose a personal interest project you will track through the course (e.g., learn guitar basics, practice AI prompts responsibly, crochet a small item, build a budget, learn a recipe series).

**Learning goals**  
- Identify what motivates you and connects to your strengths/interests.  
- Plan a realistic self-directed goal with small checkpoints.  
- Explain why the project matters to you.

## What to do (complete in the assigned Google Doc)
1) **What you like doing**: list things you enjoy outside school (hobbies, activities, topics you read/watch).  
2) **Lead-up questions** (answer briefly):  
   - What makes you curious right now?  
   - When do you feel “in the zone”?  
   - What’s a skill you wish you had started earlier?  
   - How much time per week could you give this?  
3) **Your proposal**: describe the interest project you want to pursue this term (5–7 sentences). Include: why it matters to you, what “done” looks like by course end, and 3 small checkpoints you can log along the way.  
4) **Resources you’ll need**: list at least 2 resources (people, sites, videos, tools) you could use.

## Deliverable
- The assigned Google Doc with all sections completed.

## How to submit
- Attach/turn in your Doc in Google Classroom.  
- Daily: log what you worked on in Pika (1–2 sentences).

## Success criteria (universal /15 rubric)
- **Completion**: lead-up questions, proposal, checkpoints, and resources are present.  
- **Thinking/communication**: proposal is specific, realistic, and personal.  
- **Workflow/authenticity**: daily Pika check-ins, organized Doc, your own words.
