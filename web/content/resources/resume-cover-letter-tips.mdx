# Resume & Cover Letter Tips (for A6)

## Resume
- Keep to one page; use a simple, readable layout.  
- Start each bullet with an action verb and a result (e.g., “Organized weekly club meetings for 12 students; improved attendance by 25%”).  
- Tailor to the posting: mirror the top 3–4 requirements in your bullets.  
- Include community, school, volunteer, or family responsibilities if you lack formal work experience.

## Cover Letter
- One page, three short paragraphs: (1) why this role/organization, (2) how you meet the top requirements with examples, (3) your next step (“I’m available for an interview…”).  
- Address to a person if possible; otherwise use “Hiring Manager.”  
- Match your tone to the role (professional and direct).

## Checklist before submitting
- Spellcheck/grammar check.  
- File names: `LastName_Resume` and `LastName_CoverLetter`.  
- Make sure the posting link is attached in Classroom with your documents.
