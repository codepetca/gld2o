    <p>Asynchronous Online Course • Grade 10 • <a href="index.html">Course Outline</a></p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Respect</h2>
    <p>Be respectful of the learning environment — your classmates, your teacher, and your own learning. In an online course, this means communicating thoughtfully and treating shared spaces (like discussion boards and collaborative tools) with care.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Staying on Schedule</h2>
    <p>This is an asynchronous course, which means you can work at your own pace within each week's timeframe. However, staying on schedule is essential. Each assignment has a suggested week on the course outline — use that as your guide.</p>
    <p>If you fall behind, reach out early. It's much easier to help you get back on track before things pile up.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Absences & Communication</h2>
    <p>If you know you'll be unavailable for an extended period, let me know in advance. You are expected to keep up with the work even during absences. Refer to the course outline for upcoming assignments and deadlines.</p>
    <p>Since this is an online course, email is the primary way to reach me: <strong>stewart.chan@yrdsb.ca</strong></p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Attendance</h2>
    <p>Attendance in this course is taken through Pika. Each class day, you must complete the <strong>"Today"</strong> section in Pika, which logs your daily activity. Once that section is filled in, you are marked present. If it is not attempted, you are marked absent.</p>
    <p>You have until the end of the day (before midnight) to complete your daily attendance. Make it part of your routine — log in, complete "Today", then continue working on your assignments.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Tech Requirements</h2>
    <p>You'll need the following to succeed in this course:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A laptop or computer with internet access</li>
      <li>A web browser (Chrome recommended)</li>
      <li>Access to your school Google account (for Pika and Google Sites)</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Home Practice</h2>
    <p>Students are expected to complete all assigned work by the given deadlines. If you don't finish during your scheduled work time, continue working on it on your own time.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Assignments & Deadlines</h2>
    <p>This is an assignments-based course. There are 10 assignments, each with a deadline listed on the course outline. You are expected to complete all of them.</p>
    <p>If you need an extension, ask before the deadline — not after.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Working in Pika</h2>
    <p>All assignments (A1–A9) are completed inside Pika, the learning platform for this course. Pika tracks your work history, including when and how you build your responses over time.</p>
    <p>Your workflow matters. Assignments should show <strong>progressive work</strong> — evidence that you developed your responses over time, not all at once in a single session. This is one of the ways we ensure the work is authentically yours.</p>
    <p>You don't need to be perfect on the first try. Drafting, revising, and improving your work is expected and encouraged. What matters is that your history reflects a genuine effort.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Plagiarism & Academic Honesty</h2>
    <p>All of your work should be original. You are welcome to use resources — including classmates, websites, and AI tools — to help you learn and develop your ideas. However, you are <strong>not allowed to copy and paste someone else's work</strong> and submit it as your own.</p>
    <p>Pika's work history makes it clear how your responses were built. A submission that appears as a single large paste with no prior drafting will be flagged for review. This isn't about catching you — it's about ensuring fairness for everyone.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Account Security</h2>
    <p>You will use your school Google account to access Pika and other course tools. Do not share your login or password with anyone. Any activity under your account is your responsibility.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p><strong>Email:</strong> stewart.chan@yrdsb.ca</p>
    <p>I'll do my best to respond within one business day. For assignment-specific questions, include the assignment number in your subject line.</p>
