    <p>Asynchronous Online Course • Grade 10 • <a href="index.html">Course Outline</a></p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Respect</h2>
    <p>Take this course seriously, but also have fun with it — there are opportunities to explore things you're genuinely interested in. Be honest in your work and respectful in any communication with your teacher or classmates.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Staying on Schedule</h2>
    <p>This is an asynchronous course, which means you can work at your own pace within each week's timeframe. However, staying on schedule is essential. Each assignment has a suggested week on the course outline — use that as your guide.</p>
    <p>If you fall behind, reach out early. It's much easier to help you get back on track before things pile up.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Due Dates</h2>
    <p>Assignments are graded the day after the due date. Whatever work has been done and saved in Pika at that point is what will be marked. For example, if an assignment is due Tuesday April 8, it will be graded on Wednesday April 9 based on what you have saved.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Communication</h2>
    <p>Check Pika for the calendar of work and due dates. This is your main reference for what's coming up and when things are due.</p>
    <p>If you have questions or need to reach me, email <strong>stewart.chan@yrdsb.ca</strong>.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Attendance</h2>
    <p>Attendance is taken through Pika. Each class day, you must answer the <strong>"What did you do today?"</strong> prompt in the Today section — a simple 1–2 sentence log of what you worked on. Once that is filled in, you are marked present. If it is not attempted, you are marked absent.</p>
    <p>You can answer before you start working, after you finish, or both — and you can update your log anytime during that day. You have until the end of the day (before midnight) to complete it.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Working in Pika</h2>
    <p>All assignments except the culminating project are completed inside Pika, the learning platform for this course. Pika tracks your work history, including when and how you build your responses over time.</p>
    <p>Your workflow matters. Assignments should show <strong>progressive work</strong> — evidence that you developed your responses over time, not all at once in a single session. You don't need to be perfect on the first try. Drafting, revising, and improving your work is expected and encouraged.</p>
    <p>All of your work should be original. You are welcome to use resources — including classmates, websites, and AI tools — to help you learn and develop your ideas. However, you are <strong>not allowed to copy and paste someone else's work</strong> and submit it as your own. A submission that appears as a single large paste with no prior drafting will be flagged for review. This isn't about catching you — it's about ensuring fairness for everyone.</p>
