  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Respect</h2>
    <p>Be respectful of the learning environment — your classmates, your teacher, and your own learning. In an online course, this means communicating thoughtfully and treating shared spaces with care.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Staying on Schedule</h2>
    <p>This is an asynchronous course, which means you can work at your own pace within each week's timeframe. However, staying on schedule is essential. Each assignment has a suggested week on the course outline — use that as your guide.</p>
    <p>If you fall behind, reach out early. It's much easier to help you get back on track before things pile up.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Communication</h2>
    <p>Check Pika for the calendar of work and due dates. This is your main reference for what's coming up and when things are due.</p>
    <p>If you have questions or need to reach me, email <strong>stewart.chan@yrdsb.ca</strong>. For assignment-specific questions, include the assignment number in your subject line.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Attendance</h2>
    <p>Attendance in this course is taken through Pika. Each class day, you must complete the <strong>"Today"</strong> section in Pika, which logs your daily activity. Once that section is filled in, you are marked present. If it is not attempted, you are marked absent.</p>
    <p>You have until the end of the day (before midnight) to complete your daily attendance. Make it part of your routine — log in, complete "Today", then continue working on your assignments.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Tech Requirements</h2>
    <p>You need a computer with internet access.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Working in Pika</h2>
    <p>All assignments (A1–A9) are completed inside Pika, the learning platform for this course. A10 is a Google Site. Pika tracks your work history, including when and how you build your responses over time.</p>
    <p>Your workflow matters. Assignments should show <strong>progressive work</strong> — evidence that you developed your responses over time, not all at once in a single session. You don't need to be perfect on the first try. Drafting, revising, and improving your work is expected and encouraged.</p>
    <p>All of your work should be original. You are welcome to use resources — including classmates, websites, and AI tools — to help you learn and develop your ideas. However, you are <strong>not allowed to copy and paste someone else's work</strong> and submit it as your own. A submission that appears as a single large paste with no prior drafting will be flagged for review. This isn't about catching you — it's about ensuring fairness for everyone.</p>
    <p>Do not share your login or password with anyone. Any activity under your account is your responsibility.</p>
