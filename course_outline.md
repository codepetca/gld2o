# GLD2O — Discovering the Workplace (Asynchronous Online)

This package contains:
- Course outline with pacing and release cadence
- Google Classroom–ready assignments (A1–A7) and final portfolio instructions
- Universal rubric (/15) used for all submissions
- Resources folder (templates, guides)

## Pacing & Weekly Rhythm
- Daily: students complete a short Pika check-in (what they worked on) while progressing on the current assignment.
- Weekly: you post a short video (2–4 minutes) previewing the plan, deadlines, and any clarifications for the current assignment.
- Release cadence: one assignment every ~1.5–2 weeks; allow overlap if students move faster.

## Assignment Sequence & Suggested Windows
- Week 1: A1 Orientation + Personal Profile (formative; due end of Week 1)
- Weeks 1–2: A1B Personal Interest Proposal (due end of Week 2)
- Weeks 3–4: A2 Essential Skills Application (due mid-Week 4)

## Assessment Weights (suggested)
- A1 Orientation: formative (0%)  
- A1B: 10%  
- A2–A6: 10% each  
- A7: 15%  
- Final Portfolio: 25%  
- All use the universal /15 rubric (Completion, Thinking/Communication, Workflow/Authenticity).

## Submission Expectations
- Submissions are primarily Google Docs (history visible); final work is a Google Site URL.
- Each assignment post includes a reminder to log daily work in Pika; keep language light, no direct links required.
- Encourage students to attach drafts or process notes to show authenticity; Pika supports workflow monitoring.

## Teacher Notes
- Maintain an internal expectations map (see `expectations_map.md`) to confirm GLD2O overall/specific expectation coverage.
- Use the weekly video to set focus, note common issues, and remind of upcoming checkpoints.
