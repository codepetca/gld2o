1) Hook (10–15 seconds): what we're focusing on this week and why it matters.
2) Current assignment status: where students should be by end of the week; remind of the due window.
3) Top 2–3 tips: common mistakes to avoid, examples of strong evidence, or how to structure the Doc/Site.
4) Pika reminder: daily 1–2 sentence log; mention any patterns you're watching (steady progress vs. rushed).

# Week 1 Video Script (under 10 min)

## Welcome
- Welcome to GLD2O — Discovering the Workplace
- This is an asynchronous online course — you work on your own schedule within each week
- Structured but relaxed — learn authentically, with accountability through due dates

## About Me
- Mr. Chan, computer science teacher at PETHS
- Interested in how we best learn and experience life in current times

## Platforms
- We use **Pika** as our main platform — this is where you do your work, track attendance, and check due dates
- There is **no requirement to complete any D2L material** — ignore it
- At the beginning and when there are gaps in Pika, we'll use **Google Classroom** as a backup
- Course overview and conduct page are linked in the **Resources tab**

## Why Pika?
- I built Pika through my company Codepet, where I explore fun companion solutions to existing problems in education
- Pika is a small mouse — your course companion
- Hope to build out a fun experience with it over time
- Your involvement and feedback would be appreciated — let me know what works and what doesn't

## Pika Walkthrough (demo)
- **Today**: This is your daily attendance. Answer "What did you do today?" — a simple 1–2 sentence log. You have until midnight. Demo filling it in.
- **Calendar**: This is where you see what's coming up, due dates, and daily guidance on what you should have done by that day
- **Assignments**: This is where your assignment work lives. You type directly in Pika. Your work history is tracked — show progressive work, not a last-minute paste.

## Course Overview (brief)
- 10 assignments across 5 units, all graded on a /30 rubric
- Assignments are graded the day after the due date — whatever is saved is what gets marked
- All assignments except the final portfolio are completed in Pika
- Point students to the course overview and conduct pages — read them

## A1 Getting Started
- Point to the assignment in Pika — read it and follow the steps
- 4 tasks: Dino Run, YouTube Explorer, Ask AI, About You
- Crop your screenshots, add captions

## Office Hours
- My office hours are **Period 5, 1:30–2:50**
- This is when I typically respond to emails, create lessons, and post videos
- Email: stewart.chan@yrdsb.ca

## Wrap Up
