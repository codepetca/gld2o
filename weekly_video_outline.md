# Weekly Video Outline (2–4 minutes)

1) Hook (10–15 seconds): what we’re focusing on this week and why it matters.
2) Current assignment status: where students should be by end of the week; remind of the due window.
3) Top 2–3 tips: common mistakes to avoid, examples of strong evidence, or how to structure the Doc/Site.
4) Pika reminder: daily 1–2 sentence log; mention any patterns you’re watching (steady progress vs. rushed).
5) Support: where to ask questions and when office hours or check-ins are.
