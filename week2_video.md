# Week 2 Video Script

## Last Week Check-In
- How was your first week? Hope you're settling in
- Check your "Today" log — make sure you're signing in each class day
- A1 has been marked and returned — check your grade and comments
- Comments are AI-generated but also human-read — I review every submission
- Tip: use the character count in the editor to make sure you're hitting the approximate length

## A2 Personal Interest Proposal
- This week you're proposing a personal project you'll work on through the course
- Think of this like a real-world proposal — in a business or work environment, you'd pitch an idea and lay out a plan before starting
- That's what this is: pick something you care about, explain why, and map out a rough timeline
- Your plan doesn't have to be perfect — it will change as you learn more about what's involved
- The point is to start with a direction
- Throughout the course, log when you do something related to your project — even small things count
- At the end of the course during your final reflection, you'll look back on what you actually did and what you learned
- Walk through the example in the assignment (baking timeline)
- Reminder: read the assignment carefully and follow the structure

## Wrap Up
- Get started on A2 — due next week
- Keep doing your "Today" every class day
