Assignment 1 — Orientation + Personal Profile + Interest Proposal

Purpose: get oriented to the course, clarify who you are as a learner/worker, and propose an interest area you want to explore this term.

Learning goals (student-friendly):
- Identify interests, strengths, needs, and values that shape your choices.
- Connect past experiences to future goals.
- Follow directions and organize work in a clear, authentic way.

What to do (complete in the assigned Google Doc):
1) Personal profile: list your top strengths, interests, values, and needs (bullet points are fine). Include one short story (5–7 sentences) about when you used one of these strengths.
2) Learning/work experiences: note 2–3 experiences (school, volunteer, job, family responsibilities) and what you learned from each.
3) Goals: write 2 short-term goals (this semester) and 1 longer-term goal (after high school), plus one action for each goal.
4) Interest proposal: name one topic/industry you want to explore this course and explain why it matters to you (5–7 sentences).

Deliverable:
- The assigned Google Doc with all four parts completed.

How to submit:

- Daily: log what you worked on in Pika (1–2 sentences).

Success criteria (uses the universal /15 rubric):
