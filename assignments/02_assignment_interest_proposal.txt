A2 Personal Interest Proposal

Purpose: Propose a personal project you'll track through the course (e.g., learn guitar, build a budget, try a recipe series, crochet something).

What to do:
1) What you like doing: List things you enjoy outside school (hobbies, activities, topics you read/watch).

2) Lead-up questions (answer briefly):
   - What makes you curious right now?
   - When do you feel "in the zone"?
   - What's a skill you wish you had started earlier?
   - How much time per week could you give this?

3) Your proposal (5–7 sentences): Describe the project you want to pursue. Include:
   - Why it matters to you
   - What "done" looks like by course end
   - 3 small checkpoints you can log along the way

4) Daily practice: Describe what a typical day or session looks like for this project. How much time? What would you actually do?

5) Resources: List at least 2 resources (people, sites, videos, tools) you could use.

How to submit:
- Complete this assignment in Pika.

Approximate length: 1500 characters (300 words)

Success criteria (/30):
- Completion: lead-up questions, proposal, checkpoints, daily practice description, and resources are present.
- Thinking/communication: proposal is specific, realistic, and personal.
- Workflow/authenticity: daily Pika check-ins, your own words.
