A4 Self-Management & Teamwork

Purpose: Reflect on how you manage your time and workload, and think about how you work with others.

What to do:

Part A: Self-Management

1) Pick a course to compare: Choose one other course you're taking this semester.

2) Compare how you manage both courses:
   - How do you stay on track in this course (GLD2O) vs. the other course?
   - What's different about how you manage your time, workload, or motivation for each?
   - Which course is easier to manage? Why?

3) What's working: What strategies have helped you stay on track? (e.g., scheduling, reminders, workspace, routines)

4) What's not working: Where have you struggled? (e.g., procrastination, distractions, unclear priorities)

5) One change: What's one specific thing you'll do differently for the rest of the semester?

Part B: Teamwork Reflection

6) A teamwork experience: Think of a time you worked with others (group project, job, volunteer work, sports team, club, etc.). Briefly describe the situation.

7) What worked and what didn't:
   - What helped the team work well together?
   - What caused problems or conflict?
   - How was conflict handled (or not)?

8) Diversity in teams: How did different perspectives, skills, or backgrounds contribute to the team's work?

9) Future teamwork: What's one thing you'll do differently next time you work on a team?
