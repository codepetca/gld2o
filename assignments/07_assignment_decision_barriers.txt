A7 Decision-Making & Barriers

Purpose: Apply a decision-making process and plan for barriers.

What to do:
1) Choose one decision related to school or work (e.g., course choice, job option, volunteer placement, skill to develop).

2) Options and criteria: List 3 options and 3–4 criteria that matter to you (cost, time, growth, interest, location, etc.).

3) Decision matrix: Create a simple table. Score each option against each criterion (1–5 scale) and total the scores.

   Example:
   | Criteria       | Option A | Option B | Option C |
   |----------------|----------|----------|----------|
   | Cost           | 4        | 2        | 5        |
   | Interest       | 5        | 4        | 3        |
   | Growth         | 3        | 5        | 4        |
   | **Total**      | **12**   | **11**   | **12**   |

4) Barriers and strategies: Name 2–3 barriers for your top option (e.g., schedule conflicts, finances, transportation) and how you'd handle them.

5) Reflection (1 paragraph): Which option did you choose and why? Does the matrix match your gut feeling? What would make you change your mind?
