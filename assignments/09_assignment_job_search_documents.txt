A9 Job Search Documents

Purpose: Create a resume and cover letter using AI, and prepare for interviews.

What to do:
1) Resume (use AI to iterate):
   - Use an AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, etc.) to draft your resume.
   - Give it the job posting from A8 and your experience/skills.
   - Paste each draft and note what you asked the AI to change and why.
   - Keep refining until you have a resume you're proud of.
   - You can keep editing after submitting — this is yours to use IRL.

2) Cover letter (use AI to iterate):
   - Same process: use AI to draft, paste each version, note your changes.
   - Final version should be targeted to the posting and sound like you.

3) Interview prep:
   - List 2 common interview questions for your target role.
   - Write brief answers to each.
   - Note one thing about non-verbal communication (dress, eye contact, body language) that matters for this role.

4) Reflection (4–6 sentences):
   - What do you still need to learn or gain to be competitive for this role?
   - What did you learn about using AI for professional documents? (What worked, what didn't, what surprised you?)

How to submit:
- Complete this assignment in Pika.

Success criteria (/30):
- Completion: resume, cover letter, interview prep, and reflection are present.
- Thinking/communication: documents targeted to the posting; AI iteration shows thoughtful refinement.
- Workflow/authenticity: multiple drafts visible with notes on changes, your own words.
