A10 Final Portfolio (Google Site)

Purpose: Showcase your learning in a single, easy-to-navigate Google Site.

What to do:
1) Create a new Google Site with clear page names and simple navigation.

2) Required pages:
   - Home: short intro and "site tour" telling visitors where to find everything
   - About Me: profile highlights (strengths, interests, values) and one story that represents you
   - Personal Interest Project: your project from A2, progress updates, and what you learned
   - Essential Skills: your skill snapshot and reflection (A3)
   - Self-Management & Teamwork: key takeaways from A4
   - Self-Assessment: your 16Personalities results and reflection (A5)
   - Career Exploration: summaries of occupations you researched (A6)
   - Decision-Making & Barriers: your decision matrix and strategies (A7)
   - Career Plan: your plan and workplace awareness answers (A8)
   - Job Search Documents: your resume and cover letter (A9)

3) Final Reflection: Add a section (on any page, or its own page) with one paragraph on growth, most useful skill, and next steps. Include 2–3 sentences on how you used AI throughout this course.

4) For each page: embed or link your work from Pika. Note what you revised.

5) Evidence of process: include at least 2 in-progress artifacts (drafts, notes, earlier versions) somewhere on the site.

What makes a strong portfolio:
- Clear menu, consistent headings, working links
- Your own words and examples
- All required pages with linked/embedded work

How to submit:
- Set sharing so anyone with the link can view.
- In Pika, submit your Site URL + a 4–5 sentence "tour" describing where to find everything.

Success criteria (/30):
- Completion: all required pages, embedded/linked work, and final reflection.
- Thinking/communication: navigation is clear; reflection shows growth.
- Workflow/authenticity: evidence of process, working links, your own words.
